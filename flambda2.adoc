# Sketch of Flambda 2.0 Semantics

Purpose: resolve misunderstandings on my side about how Flambda 2.0 works. May serve as a draft for a formal semantics of Flambda 2.0, but will not be completed in every detail.

## Top-Level State
* _current_continuation_: ContinuationValue
* _heap_: Ref -> Value

## Smaller parts that make up the top-level state
* Continuation
* Expression
* Ref
* Value
* ContinuationValue
** _env_: Environment
** _body_: Expression
* Environment =
** _continuations_ : Continuation -> ContinuationValue
** _return_cont_: Continuation
** _exn_cont_: Continuation
