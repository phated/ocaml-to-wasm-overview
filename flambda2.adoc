# Sketch of Flambda 2.0 Semantics

Purpose: resolve misunderstandings on my side about how Flambda 2.0 works. May serve as a draft for a formal semantics of Flambda 2.0, but will not be completed in every detail.

## Top-Level State
* env: Environment
** k: Continuation
** e: Continuation
* h: Ref -> Value
* Current function body

## Smaller parts that make up the top-level state
* Continuation
* Expression
