# Linking of WebAssembly modules

* Wat to Asm linker ? #1133 https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/issues/1133i

Summary: There exists an unofficial specification for "wasm object files" which is implemented by LLVM's `wasm-ld` tool. This is using C linking conventions.

In case of using the WebAssembly GC extension to represent values, linking might turn out to be as simple as concatenating several modules (and dropping all imports/exports that are resolved?).
